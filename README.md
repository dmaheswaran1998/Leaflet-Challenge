# Leaflet-Challenge

## Enjoy the Interactive Maps that have been created:

## Note : In order to enjoy the maps, you will need to sign up for a mapbox API key. Please enter this API key in the config.js file in the folder in both Leaflet Step 1 and Leaflet Step 2. 

### Once this key is entered into the config.js file, you will be able to enjoy the two maps.

## Leaflet Step-1
1. Once you have put the API Mapbox key into the config.js file, feel free to enjoy this map!
2. When you click on the different circles a tooltip will display the Location and magnitude of the earthquake.
3. The size of the circle and the colour of the earthquake circle reflect the size of the earthquake. 
4. The legend at the bottom left corner of the map provides more detail on how the colour of the circle and magnitude of the eartquake relate to each other. 

## Leaflet Step-2
1. Once again a mapbox API key needs to be inserted into the config.js file
2. This map is more interactive, you can choose between three base layers; a satellite layer, a light layer and a streetmap layer
3. You can also choose between showing the information on earthquake locations, tectonic plate boundaries or display both at the same time.

# Enjoy!
